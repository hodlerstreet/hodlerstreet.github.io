Invest in them at your own risk. It has been almost 3 months since I started investing in cryptocurrencies despite studying about it for almost an year now. Hey, don’t curse me just now! We Indians have reservations when we need to spend money on risky business. So, it all started with Ethereum. 2xed my portfolio soon enough. It was awestrucking to me. And then I came to know about other altcoins. Read their whitepapers. Read more. Diversified my portfolio. Started getting better returns than Ethereum alone could manage. And then the greed grew. It became a never ending desire to have a greater return than what I was getting. So I ventured into other relatively smaller exchanges like Kucoin and Cryptopia from Binance, where I could find smaller market cap coins which had the potential to go 50x. And then came the nightmare of maintaining a host number of public keys. And then it occured to me, the problems the whales and experienced traders must have had all this time. So, I explored possible solutions that existed in the market and I bumped into Ethos token. What is the Ethos token?As stated on their website, ETHOS is an access token that enables anybody to securely manage their cryptocurrency wallets, keys and coins. For a more in depth roadmap and vision of the company, I would suggest you to read their whitepaper. Simply put, they are trying to create a democratized economy that makes the cryptocurrency market accessible and trustworthy to the average user, accelerating adoption of blockchain technology and democratizing ownership of both digital and traditional assets. They plan to create a universal wallet to efficiently manage keys with the help of Ethos token and reward people for promoting financial knowledge. Is it the solution?What Ethos is trying to do is definitely a problem worth solving, the reason why they are roughly placed at the 78th position on the CoinMarketCap in terms of market cap. The team they currently compose of have a wealth of experience at their disposal. But there are definitely some points noticing before someone invests in them for the ecosystem they are trying to create. Token AllocationOut of the total 225 million Ethos token, only about 75 million is in circulation. That means about 60-70% of the total supply is kept by the founders. By the cryptocurrency markets in general that is greedy to be honest. Plus when Ripple is somewhat viewed as a centralised currency in the crypto space, I fail to understand why fingers are not raised for this coin on similar grounds. Github RepositoryIf someone is looking to invest in a particular cryptocurrency, reading the source code of the repository somewhat brings trust about the work the company is doing on day to day basis. Now, if you would go searching for Ethos github repository, sorry to disappoint you, you won’t find any. And that’s because they are a closed source project right now. Despite an active telegram group, close sourcing the project is just purely contrary to the belief that the crypto world today is built upon, and sadly a big red flag when it comes to due diligence of a coin. Partial DecentralisationGiven that the Ethos as a company would cater to a Fiat gateway, they will be implementing regulatory measures such as KYC and AML measures which means they will have trust factors introduced in the ecosystem they are trying to create which ultimately may become a roadblock operating and competing with other decentralised options. ConclusionThe problem of key management is undoubtedly a massive problem right now to solve in a decentralised manner. The fact that Stephen Corliss, ex- COO of BlackRock joined Ethos shows the underlying strength of the Ethos team and credibility of the token. What they are trying to achieve is highly ambitious but it remains to be seen whether they truly deliver what they envision given the questioning decisions they have taken so far.

The claims that the founder made in the video caused an existential crisis deep down. Not in real life but definitely in the crypto world. It occured to me as the Thanos waiting for his time to conquer the Avengers’ universe. I had to research more about it. It just seemed too good to be true. And so I did. So what is Hashgraph? Simply put, it is a distributed ledger technology which does not uses Blockchain as its core data structure, is asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant, processes about 250,000 transactions per second, does not use resource intensive consensus algorithms like Proof of Work and gives discrete surety about the confirmation of the transaction. They use two basic algorithms - Gossip protocol and virtual voting. Well that was a mouthful. But it does work. For a more detailed guide into the groundbreaking algorithm I would suggest reading its official whitepaper and if you want to understand it in English, do give this medium post a read. If you want to see a working product built on its Java SDK, you could check this out this devpost. They sponsored the TechCrunch 2017 Hackathon. Do notice the minimal network latency in between the devices. It literally blew my mind when I realised this was without the use of a server. Implications of the Technology We do realise that the technology is breathtaking. I mean they won a contract for delivering the technology to the CULedger serving roughly a 104 million customers (link). So,no doubts about that in my opinion. What I personally want to discuss here are the implications of the technology. One of the best things I found about the technology was its ability to run a light node at will. So what it means is, unlike blockchains which have a probabilistic consensus they have a confirmed consensus. A probabilistic consensus here means that one can never be certain the order of transactions included in the blockchain are indeed correct. The probability only increases as more and more blocks gets added into the single state ledger. A confirmed consensus on the other hand, after a certain number of rounds of voting, the history of the transactions achieves global truth which means a probability of one despite being a non deterministic system. Hence a light node can act as a full node by not storing the history of transactions which have been successfully verified, thereby enabling someone to run a full node on mobile phone itself. My biggest concern around the technology is Swirlds’ decision to put an IP on the technology. On one hand we have blockchain which is promoted as open-sourced solution. Satoshi could have gone on the same path as Hashgraph but that wouldn’t have worked out the way it has. We wouldn’t have a crypto ecosystem that is ever growing like today. Moreover, he/she/they sit on a fortune of roughly around $10 Billion dollars at the current price of bitcoin. Therefore, hashgraph by venturing into the private permissioned networks such as Credit Unions took far lesser challenge with lower growth potential than what it might have been had they released a cryptocurrency themselves and competed in the open markets. Though they plan to release a public protocol in the future, but I doubt they will succeed without open-sourcing their technology altogether. Secondly, they self-proclaim that Hashgraph can sustain about 250,000 transactions per second. They even claim that number in a highly scaled environment. But reputed people in the space like Vitalik Buterin - founder of Ethereum have raised questions on its scalability time and time again. They believe directed acyclic graphs like the hashgraph will face the same issues as them when deployed in a public environment where chances of Sybil attacks are more prominent. Moreover, they argued that even though hashgraph manages to scale itself with a larger pool of transactions, it will not be able to provide the same throughput when a larger number of nodes are drawn into the picture. ConclusionThe beauty of network effect is what is keeping Bitcoin alive today. It has the first mover’s advantage and people are considering it as a digital gold despite its shortcomings. Whether Hashgraph kills the whole cryptocurrency domain remains to be seen, but what Bitcoin has taught us is that whatever the technology is, its the adoption that ultimately wins.

Invest in them at your own risk. INS token is a cryptocurrency that aims to decentralize the online grocery ecosystem by removing the middlemen that is the retailers and the wholesalers with the help of Blockchain and smart contract. It is somewhat tackling the reduced market shares of home grown manufacturers by private labels such Amazon Basics and at the same time providing groceries at the cheaper rate to the consumers. Now, as far as the problem statement is concerned, I think is fantastic. But, I am highly sceptical about the industry that they are involved in - hyperlocal grocery. I mean look around yourself and analyse the centralised internet companies existing in the space. None. Practically no single big player. For the existing players, it is just a cycle of endless pivots and venture fundings till they realise that the unit economics is just not sustainable. Hyperlocal startups particularly in the groceries domain face an uphill battle when they try to scale exponentially. They compete with the locals who run grocery carts and are much less likely to lose money on a product with significantly low shelf life than them.If we take an example from the history, I think Webvan completely fits the thought. What started as a revolutionary offline, online hybrid consortium of elements to deliver groceries door-to-door filed a bankruptcy soon after. That’s roughly around a billion dollars of venture capital down the drain. Billion with a ‘b’. And instead of going into the details of why hyperlocal grocery startups generally fail to cement their market positions which is basically just a Google search away, I think I would rather write about the decentralised aspects of the token. Other ProblemsToken Allocation They sit on roughly about 30-40% of the total token size which I feel is high as compared to other coins. Frankly, it is controlling in some sense. Normally, the coins in the market that are in for the long haul and genuinely believe in decentralisation usually house around 10 to 20 percent of the total supply. Therefore, I feel the tokens to be another one of the red flags in the project. Fulfillment Centers Another one of the key areas which drew my attention is the role of fulfillment centers in the whole ecosystem that they are trying to create. Who these fulfillment centers are going to be? Can anyone with a yard of space provide fulfillment services? How will the INS decide who to trust when there is going to more than one in an area?Fulfillment centers in my honest opinion introduces trust in the trustless system that they envision. Plus they plan to employ third party to do the box moving (as mentioned in one of the Q&amp;A sessions with the company’s CEO) which is again does not add up for me. Supply Chain InnovationThey claim that their platform will have blockchain integrated into their supply chain management which I believe is great. But their beta starts not before the quarter of 2018 whereas other decentralised companies in the supply chain domain like WABI, VEN and WTC already have their products involving RFID technology in the working state and partnerships with established companies and governments in place which definitely gives them the first movers’ advantage. ConclusionAll in all I think there are too many moving parts in the system and though I would brand it as somewhat a highly ambitious project, I think there is not much use of the INS token in general in the system. They are basically riding the hype wave and I feel ETH is just as useful in the operations of the ecosystem. Hope they succeed in what they are trying to achieve, but hodling wise, I would prefer to maintain a distance.

And it is no secret that all the top media companies in the country are influenced by one or the other political parties and hence the government. Even the finance minister of the country Mr. Arun Jaitley has voiced concerns about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But that is definitely not stopping the Indians enter the mad race to multiply their crypto holdings. Now, buying cryptocurrencies is definitely a herculean task until you familiarize yourself with the whole process. And boy it is heart wrenching when you know one wrong digit in the public address and the funds are lost forever. But fair to say, when you have potential to 5x-10x your investments, I feel it is worth the risky play. Talking about exchanges, the first that comes to mind to an Indian are Indian exchanges. But you know what they really are - They basically cook shit. There have been multiple cases of wallet thefts in the past. Along with that, they are in a constant state of inefficiencies. Sometimes regarding withdrawal of the funds. Other times server down situations. Plus the Indian government literally crack down on them whenever they feel like. And hence it is figuratively a crime to keep your valuable cryptos on the Indian exchanges. The solution Well all’s not doomed for us Indians. The exchanges are good enough to exchange your Fiat currency with the stable cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Exchanges like throughbit and zebpay have good enough reputation. Or better Coinbase. Though it doesn’t offer insurance outside of United States. Have your KYC done and buy from them. A word of caution though, Bitcoin have high transaction fees and hence if your motive is to trade altcoins, then Ethereum would be much better choice for you to purchase. After the purchase, transfer them to foreign exchanges like Binance , Bittrex , Kucoin or Bitfinex to buy altcoins. I warn you to buy alts from Koinex . It is expected to doom. Exchange to exchange transfers take somewhat more time. Hence it is better if you transfer it to a paper wallet like myetherwallet and then transfer it to a foreign exchange.

Two major utilized cryptocurrency hardware wallets currently are Trezor and Ledger. Major advantages over standard wallets are: Private keys are stored in a protected area of a microcontroller, and cannot be transferred out of the device in plain text. Immune to computer viruses that steal from software wallets. Can be used securely and interactively, as opposed to a paper wallet which must be imported to software at some point. Much of the time, the software is open-source allowing a user to validate the entire operation of the device. The main principle behind the hardware wallets is to provide the full isolation between the cryptographic secrets (private keys) and your easy to hack computer or smartphone. Vulnerabilities of modern PCs and smartphones are well known and if you keep your private keys there, it’s just a matter of time before you’ll get hacked and lose your bitcoins. A paper wallet may be secure, but only until you want to use your funds, requiring importing your private keys on your computer. And if you think a password encrypting your keys is enough, a malware is smart enough to wait for the inevitable decryption before sweeping your funds. Hardware wallets are convenient, affordable, portable and backed up by a paper wallet allowing easy recovery in case of loss. If you have any significant amount of bitcoins, using a hardware wallet should be a no brainer. SeedThe recovery seed usually contains a sequence of 24 words uniquely and securely generated inside your hardware wallet, when you first set it up. It is of utmost importance to keep this backup sentence secret and safe. In case your wallet is lost you can recover your wallet with recovery seed. Trezor Wallet Trezor is the hardware device that hosts the wallet. As in a normal wallet that we use on a daily basis there are pouches for different things like one for driving licence and other for money and further sections depending on the stuff you are carrying. Similarly wallet in Trezor, there are separate pouches for different currencies one for Bitcoin, one for Ethereum, also for your U2F identity, etc. Everything you need is in one wallet. Each seed generates only one wallet. Unlike a wallet, for which you only have one per seed, you can have many accounts (for every currency separately). Compare this to your bank accounts — you might have a Checking account and a Savings account. As they are separate accounts, they are completely independent, save from the fact that they are generated from the same seed. Account 1 does not see what is in Account 2, etc. Ledger Nano S Ledger Nano S is a secure Bitcoin and Ethereum hardware wallet. It connects to any computer through USB and embeds a built-in OLED display to double check and confirm each transaction with a single tap on its side buttons. To date there have been no verifiable incidents of Bitcoins stolen from hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are relatively new, but at least for the time being they have maintained a good track record, unlike the numerous incidents of Bitcoin theft from Internet-connected computers. How a hardware wallet cannot protect your Bitcoins Malware swaps recipient bitcoin address - During serial communication when recipient address in sent to hardware device for signing the transaction, malware can swap the actual address and the transaction would be signed for hacker’s bitcoin address. Insecure RNG (Random Number Generator) - hardware wallets rely on the security of an RNG, often embedded in hardware, to generate your wallet’s private keys securely. Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to verify the true randomness of the RNG. An insecure RNG may create wallet keys that can later be recreated by an attacker, by generating pseudo-randomness that would seem statistically indistinguishable from true randomness yet still be predictable to an advanced attacker. Compromised production process - even a perfect software and hardware implementation of a hardware wallet would be vulnerable to a corrupt production process that introduces intentional or unintentional holes into the final product. The introduction of hardware backdoors is a real concern for high risk financial and military applications.

The guy is definitely a strong advocate of cryptocurrencies. But the question arises how serious he actually is about cryptocurrencies and whether should someone follow his advice? Well, YES and NO. Why No? Let’s just cut to the chase, he talks shit. I mean, just name the coins he has vouched for over the crypto boom period - DigiByte(DGB), Burst, Kilowatt Hour Coin (KWH), Electronium (ETN) and more. If you go by the backgrounds of the coins he has vouched for, it is awful. Crypto Experts have often criticized him for market manipulation and shouting out coins which really have no core developer team and their projects are a mere marketing gimmick or micro changes on top of really solid crypto projects. Most of the coins have him as an advisor and hence it is quite obvious to see why they appear on his twitter timeline. Recent ICOs like Bob’s Repair are good friends to him, and you shouldn’t be surprised when you see their mention as well. Wait did I mention about his endorsing price. Shhhh…. , it needs to be kept under wraps! Why YES? Even though McAfee lost most of his $100 million fortune he earned through his company, we just cannot neglect the fact that he was one of the greatest internet pioneers of all time. And that blue tick on his twitter is clearly indicative of the fact that he influences decisions. In this case, coins. Cheap ones. One of his tweets made Verge(XVG), a relatively unknown coin surge almost 800% in one week! See for yourself. He is currently buying low market cap coins before tweeting and selling them 2x to 5x profit after the wave travels. Recently, he has started tweeting about one alt each day which are relatively lower in the pecking order in terms of market cap. Massive pumps are being witnessed each day in the coin he tweets about. It’s truly a Christmas come early for day traders who grab a few of those just as he tweets. Easy money I would say! ConclusionAll in all, if you are someone who are haunted by the idea of constant checking of your phone to track micro movements in the prices, day trading is definitely not for you and hence you are better off betting on more stabler coins such as Ethereum, Litecoin or Bitcoin. In such a case, never follow his coins. If you are an opportunist, who wants to remain in this game longer, breath crypto in a more active state and hodl on good coins before they become mainstream, you may look into his coins but DYOR by reading whitepapers before going all in. But if you are someone who lives graphs and are/aspire to become a crypto trader, he is definitely the guy to follow for you. Just take the 2x profit from his coins each day as he announces cheap alts and sell before the dawn in your quest to become a crypto millionaire.
